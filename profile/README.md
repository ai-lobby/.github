# AI Lobby

## About

This project is a self-educational initiative for whoever wants to help. We aim to develop a website that will provide an interface to interact with AI models. This interactions will be mediated by an API, that communicates with some microservices. So, the general idea is to train programming skills, microservices (and because of it, gRPC, proto-buffers, etc) understanding and learn from program to deploy (not in real production, but ok) working AI models.
